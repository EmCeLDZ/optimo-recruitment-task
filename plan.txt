PROJECT: Room Renovation Plan
TIMELINE: 4 Days

**DAY 1: Preparation & Procurement**

1.0 Clear out: Move all furniture to the hallway. Remove switch covers and socket frames.
1.1 Protect: Cover the floor with heavy-duty cardboard (foil tears too easily). Tape skirting boards carefully using high-quality painter’s tape.

**DAY 2: Surface Treatment & Painting**

2.0 Repair: Fill old drill holes and cracks with spackle. Sand smooth once dry.
2.1 Paint Job: Apply primer first. Follow with two coats of the main color
Tip: Remove the masking tape while the second coat is still slightly wet to ensure sharp edges.

**DAY 3: Assembly & Finalization**

3.0 Furniture: Assemble the new desk and shelves.
3.1 Layout: Position the desk perpendicular to the window to avoid screen glare.
3.2 Cable Management: Route all cables (PC, monitors, power strips) into organizers before pushing the desk against the wall.

**DAY 4: Final Setup**

4.0 Lighting: Install the ceiling lamp and desk lighting.
4.1 Clean: Vacuum construction dust thoroughly before bringing electronics back in.
